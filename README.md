# JavaScript Basics

This repository contains a series of katas I completed as part of Command Shift bootcamp. I used JavaScript to write functions involving numbers, strings, booleans, arrays and objects.

It is based on a repository of test cases and empty function definitions cloned from: https://github.com/CommandShiftHQ/javascript-basics
